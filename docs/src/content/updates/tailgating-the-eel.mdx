description: While testing in the field, we attached a camera to see what it would look like tailgating the Eel in the murky waters of Mälaren. And honestly, there's not much to see.

## "Does it have a camera?" 

That's the most common question we get asked. And the answer to that has always been no. 

Until recently when we decided to tow a GoPro behind it. 

Maybe this footage from barely below the surface will be a hint as to why we haven't prioritized to mount a camera when operating in lake Mälaren.
