title: Work logg 2023-08-29 - Change AD converter
description: Changed AD converter from ADS1015 (I2C) to MCP3208 (SPI)

## What did we do?

We created a new implementation of the distance sensor class where we use another AD converter called MCP3208 that uses SPI buss for communication instead of I2C. The idea is that the SPI buss is more resistant to magnetic disturbanses then the I2C bus giving us a more robust system.

## Learnings

- Implementation was fairly straight forward and the module layout is working
- Issue with the sensors always returning the same value, after a lot of debugging we belive that it was related to permissions on the SPI-dev file.
- Installed spidev (This is the probable solution to the issue)

## Solution

Change permissions and groups for the spi-dev.

```
sudo groupadd spiuser
sudo usermod -aG spiuser <yourusername>
sudo chown :spiuser <put the spi device name here>
sudo chmod g+rw <put the spi device name here>
```
- install spidev https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VQIfGnMMt0
- reboot

## Notes

This way you can run the ros nodes individually and it allows for easier logging

```
ros2 run eel tank --ros-args -p simulate:=False -p cmd_topic:=/tank_front/cmd -p status_topic:=/tank_front/status -p motor_pin:=23 -p direction_pin:=18 -p tank_floor_value:=0.66 -p tank_ceiling_value:=0.16 -p distance_sensor_channel:=0
```

```
ros2 run eel tank --ros-args -p simulate:=False -p cmd_topic:=/tank_rear/cmd -p status_topic:=/tank_rear/status -p motor_pin:=24 -p direction_pin:=25 -p tank_floor_value:=0.288 -p tank_ceiling_value:=0.005 -p distance_sensor_channel:=1
```
