It started to get a bit frosty at our outdoor testing site. We kindly asked a local public indoor swimming pool if we could do some testing in their facility, and much to our joy they said yes!

So here is a short clip of the AUV diving around in crystal clear water for the very the first time.

Hopefully we get to do some more clear water testing, and a bunch of other exciting stuff we have planned for 2024.
