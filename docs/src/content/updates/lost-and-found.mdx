The AUV Ålen was off on a mission, and we thought we had waved goodbye for the last time 👋

There were some nervous minutes where we got no signs of life back from it. All of us thought for a second that it was gone for good and we had to start all over again, building it from scratch. Luckily, all our emergency systems kicked in, and we finally got some pings back. Both from the emergency buoy and Ålen itself.

It had aborted the mission and was floating against the rocks of Lindholmen. Watch us find it in the video above.

🙏
