## What did we do?

We used our gamepad and an ethernet cable connection to control the Eel from land.

## Learnings

- Steering the Eel to a depth worked well with the new vertical axis control.
- However, quite hard to do that manually. Since it was impossible to see the thing when it was deeper than 1 meter, we had no idea what we were doing.
- We need visualization of the depth and also the pitch.
- We need a longer cable.
